This is a nuspec. It mostly adheres to https://docs.nuget.org/create/Nuspec-Reference. Chocolatey uses a special version of NuGet.Core that allows us to do more than was initially possible. As such there are certain things to be aware of:

* the package xmlns schema url may cause issues with nuget.exe
* Any of the following elements can ONLY be used by choco tools - projectSourceUrl, docsUrl, mailingListUrl, bugTrackerUrl, packageSourceUrl, provides, conflicts, replaces
* nuget.exe can still install packages with those elements but they are ignored. Any authoring tools or commands will error on those elements

    <summary>Install the right WebDriver version for your Windows 10 build</summary>
    <description>While the Microsoft Edge WebDriver downloads are available in https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/webdriver/,
    it's very common to end up using a wrong version. Even more, starting with
    the Windows 10 18H2 update WebDriver will be a feature of the OS.
    This packages automatically installs the right version for WebDriver based
    on your Windows 10 build number.
    This package will add `MicrosoftWebDriver.exe` to your `PATH` so it can be used
    anywhere.
    Only stable versions of Windows 10 are supported prior build 17134.</description>
